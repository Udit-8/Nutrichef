3. Run the chatbot:

```bash
cd chatbot
python main.py
```

## Usage

## Data Requirements

The chatbot expects JSON data files in the `../raw_data/` directory:
- `recipes_raw.json` - Recipe database

2. Implement the required abstract methods
3. Add intent patterns to `IntentClassifier`
4. Register the journey in `ChatbotManager`
5. Follow the step-by-step flow defined in your design document
