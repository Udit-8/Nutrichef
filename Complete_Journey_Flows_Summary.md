## üö® Mistakes Made During Development

### 1. **Initial Flow Design Issues**
- **Problem**: Original flows were linear without proper step progression
- **Example**: Meal planning jumped directly to results without collecting user preferences
- **Impact**: Users couldn't make meaningful choices or get personalized results

### 2. **Hardcoded Results**
- **Problem**: Results were fixed regardless of user selections
- **Example**: Meal planning always showed 3-day plans even when user selected "2 weeks"
- **Impact**: User choices felt meaningless, poor personalization

### 3. **Incorrect Cooking Guidance Architecture**
- **Problem**: Originally designed as recipe selector instead of interactive cooking assistant
- **Example**: Offered numbered recipe choices with non-selectable cuisine categories
- **Impact**: Confused user interface, didn't match design specifications

### 4. **Command Recognition Issues**
- **Problem**: Commands like "show available recipes" treated as recipe names
- **Example**: User typing "show available recipes" got "recipe not found" error
- **Impact**: Core functionality broken, poor user experience

### 5. **Telegram Markdown Parsing Errors**
- **Problem**: Complex markdown formatting caused parsing failures
- **Example**: "Can't parse entities" error when displaying recipe lists
- **Impact**: Bot crashes, session resets required

### 6. **Database Search Logic Flaws**
- **Problem**: Inflexible search criteria causing "no meal found" issues
- **Example**: 400-calorie breakfast search failed because database range was 220-335 calories
- **Impact**: Users couldn't find meals even with reasonable requests
